# Human Software Exercise

Before you start writing instructions for the computer, why don't you warm up by writing instructions for another human? This exercise will help us identify challenges and issues relevant to writing successful software.

## Instructions

Use a combination of command line and text editor to create a new empty folder somewhere on your machine, perhaps on your Desktop, and place inside it a new Markdown file called `instructions.md`.

Pick two processes or activities you engage in on a daily basis. One should be the process of brushing your teeth. The other is your choice.

For each process, write instructions in English to communicate to another human, perhaps even a child, how to perform that process.

Record your instructions in the `instructions.md` file. You might consider use the following template:

    # Human Software

    Author: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME

    ## Brushing Teeth

    Some written instructions here. Maybe numbered:

      1. Do something.
      2. Do something else.
      3. Do a third thing.

    ## My Other Process

    Some written instructions here. Maybe numbered:

      1. Do something.
      2. Do something else.
      3. Do a third thing.

## Submission Instructions

Use the GitHub.com online interface to create a new GitHub repository, then and add a file to it called `instructions.md`. Paste your instructions into that file, then save and commit it. At this time you should be able to view your instructions online at your repository's URL.

After you have committed your file, add a new record to the [submissions file](submissions.csv), to include your GitHub username and the repository's URL.

You will need to submit a Pull Request for your content to be included in this course repository. See the [Contributor Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions. At this time, you should expect to be able to submit a PR using the GitHub online interface, so ignore references to the Git CLI.
