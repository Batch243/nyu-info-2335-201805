# Version Control Exercise

> Prerequisites: [Git Overview](/notes/git/notes.md)

## Objectives

Practice incorporating version control into your development process.

## Setup

Choose and install a Git client, whether it be a [command-line utility](/notes/git/cli.md#installation) or a [GUI application](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

You will use this chosen Git client to perform version control-related tasks as you complete the instructions below.

## Instructions

Revisit and re-create the [Python Datatypes Exercise](/exercises/python-datatypes/exercise.md), except practice version control during the development process.

When you [setup](/exercises/python-datatypes/exercise.md#setup) your directory, also initialize a Git repository and make your first commit with a message like "Setup repo".

Then, work through each of the [checkpoint challenges](/exercises/python-datatypes/exercise.md#checkpoints) individually, committing your changes after implementing each. By the time you are done, you will have produced a complete version history similar to this [example history](https://github.com/s2t2/groceries-project/commits/master).

When you are done, optionally push your repository to GitHub and [optionally submit it here](submissions.csv).
