## Projects

After submitting a Freestyle Project Proposal, it's time to move on to more in-depth project development and testing.

+ [Self-directed (a.k.a. "Freestyle") Project](/projects/freestyle/project.md) - Implementation Phase

By now, the professor has reviewed all project proposals submitted on-time, and has responded with comments and suggestions on your proposal's Pull Request. Depending on your GitHub notification settings, you will likely have received an email notification which includes the comments, but if not, you can always view the comments by visiting your closed Pull Request. If you forget which Pull Request was yours, you can always [search for Pull requests authored by you, changing "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" in the search terms to your own username](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3AYOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME). If you are having any issues accessing the professor's review of your proposal, let the professor know as soon as possible.

If for any reason you need to change your project idea, it's OK! Just make sure to update your project repository's `PLANNING.md` document accordingly.

If your project involves making API requests using your own API credentials, start thinking of a way the professor will be able to evaluate your application. If you are comfortable sharing your API Key with the professor privately via Slack DM, that is one option. Another option would be to provide the professor with detailed instructions in your project repository's `README.md` file on how to sign up to all the relevant services and obtain the necessary credentials.

## Assignments

Hey, you haven't forgotten about the Industry Insights Assignment, have you? If you haven't already attended an event, sometime after tonight's class would be a good time to find one and put it on your calendar.
