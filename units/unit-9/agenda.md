> NOTE: By now, the professor has reviewed all project proposals submitted on-time, and has responded with comments and suggestions on your proposal's Pull Request. Depending on your GitHub notification settings, you will likely have received an email notification which includes the comments, but if not, you can always view the comments by visiting your closed Pull Request. If you forget which Pull Request was yours, you can always [search for Pull requests authored by you, by changing "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" in the search terms to your own username](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3AYOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME). If you are having any issues accessing the professor's review of your proposal, let the professor know as soon as possible.

> NOTE: If for any reason you need to change your project idea, it's OK! Just make sure to update your project repository's `PLANNING.md` document accordingly.
