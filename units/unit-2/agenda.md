# Unit 2 Agenda

## Objectives

In this unit, we will take a guided tour of the Python programming language. We'll start by familiarizing ourselves with some introductory Python reference materials, then we will illustrate and apply these concepts as we work through a guided exercise.

## Discussions and Notes

Please read through the following materials in order. As you review this material, take opportunities to execute the referenced code snippets and observe the results.

So now might be a good time to create a new Python script somewhere on your computer, perhaps on your Desktop, named `learning.py`. Then revise/overwrite it as you encounter new Python examples and materials, and execute it from the command-line (e.g. `python learning.py` or `python3 learning.py`) to observe the results. The practice of typing the code yourself will help you learn.

    + [Functions](functions.md)
    + [Control Flow](control-flow.md)
    + [Debugging](debugging.md) (Intermediate Concept)
    + [Datatypes](datatypes.md):
      + [None](datatypes/none.md)

## Exercises

Once you have sufficiently reviewed these materials, this exercise should help you practice some of the more common and important techniques:

Help each other out! Ask questions in person and in Slack! Before class is over, we will convene to share solutions to this exercise.
