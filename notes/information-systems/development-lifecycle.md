# Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Common approaches include Traditional/Waterfall, Agile, and everything in-between.

## Traditional

Discrete Steps:

  1. Planning
  2. Analysis
  3. Design
  4. Implementation
  5. Maintenance

## Agile

> Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly. - [Atlassian Agile Coach](https://www.atlassian.com/agile)

### Agile vs agile

The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) describes an official set of principles which comprise the "Agile" approach. Among them are:

  + *"[The] highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software"*
  + *"The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."*
  + *"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly."*

> Agile isn't defined by a set of ceremonies or specific development techniques. Rather, agile is a group of methodologies that demonstrate a commitment to tight feedback cycles and continuous improvement. - [Atlassian Agile Coach](https://www.atlassian.com/agile)
