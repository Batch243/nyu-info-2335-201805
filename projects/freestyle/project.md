# Self-Directed (a.k.a. "Freestyle") Project

The Self-Directed Project provides students with the flexibility to follow their own interests by proposing and ultimately implementing their own application software. First students will brainstorm and submit a proposal outlining their projectâ€™s scope, objectives, and requirements. Then students will implement the requirements by writing their own Python program. The final project deliverable will include not only the software itself, but also accompanying version history, documentation, and automated tests.

## Proposal Phase

During the project proposal phase, students will define project scope and objectives and submit this information to the professor for approval. After reviewing the proposals, the professor may offer suggestions to help refine project focus, share helpful resources, and/or provide other guidance to help students succeed.

For more details, see the [Proposal Instructions](proposal.md).

## Implementation Phase

During the project implementation phase, students will write application software in Python. The software should transform information inputs into information outputs to achieve stated objectives as outlined in the project proposal. The software should strive to demonstrate a unique set of functionality which differentiates it in some significant way from other potential student submissions. If building upon an example project or previous project submission, the software should strive to differentiate itself from the example and/or add upon it in a significant way.
