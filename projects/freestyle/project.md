# Self-Directed (a.k.a. "Freestyle") Project

The Self-Directed Project provides students with the flexibility to follow their own interests by proposing and ultimately implementing their own application software. First students will brainstorm and submit a proposal outlining their projectâ€™s scope, objectives, and requirements. Then students will implement the requirements by writing their own Python application. The final project deliverable will include not only the software itself, but also accompanying version history, documentation, and automated tests.

> NOTE: students may work independently or in teams of up to three members. If students do choose to work in teams, each is expected to contribute to the application's version history, and the team should strive to create an application with a greater scope and/or difficulty level than described below.

## Phases

### Proposal Phase

During the project proposal phase, students will define project scope and objectives and submit this information to the professor for approval. After reviewing the proposals, the professor may offer suggestions to help refine project focus, share helpful resources, and/or provide other guidance to help students succeed.

For more details, see the [Proposal Instructions](proposal.md).

### Implementation Phase

During the project implementation phase, students will write application software in Python. The application should transform information inputs into information outputs to achieve stated objectives and satisfy user needs as outlined in the project proposal.

For more details, see the "requirements" section below.

## Requirements

  1. The application must transform one or more **information inputs** into one or more **information outputs** to achieve one or more **stated objectives or user needs**. The scope and difficulty level of this application should match or slightly exceed that of the recent class projects (i.e. Inventory Management App, Stocks App). For other examples of projects with reasonable scope, see the "Examples" section below.

  2. The application should strive to demonstrate a **unique set of functionality** which differentiates it in some significant way from other potential student submissions. If building upon one of the project examples, the application should also strive to differentiate itself from the example and/or build-upon it in a significant way.

  3. The application's repository should include clear **installation, setup, and usage instructions**. And it should include a **license**.

  4. The application should be developed incrementally, and the application's repository should reflect an **incremental version history**.

  5. The application should be written in Python, and should **run without error**.

  6. The application should be accompanied by reasonable and appropriate **automated tests**.

## Examples

> NOTE: The examples below illustrate reasonable implementations of subject matter and scope for this project, however they may not necessarily deliver on all project requirements. If you have any questions about what is required, defer to the project requirements, not these examples.

## Submission Instructions

After following the [submission instructions for the project proposal](proposal.md#submission-instructions), you will have already satisfied the submission instructions for the deliverable as well, as long as you end up developing your application in the same repository you submitted during the proposal phase.

## Evaluation

The project proposal will be evaluated according to its own separate [proposal criteria](proposal.md#evaluation).

The project deliverable will be evaluated based on the following criteria (also described in the "requirements" section above):

Category | Weight
--- | ---
Satisfies Proposed Objectives | 15%
Uniqueness of Subject Matter and Implementation | 10%
Repository Requirements (README w/ Instructions, LICENSE) | 15%
Incremental Version History | 15%
Automated Tests | 10%
Runs without error | 20%
User Experience | 15%

This rubric is tentative, and may be subject to slight adjustments during the grading process.
