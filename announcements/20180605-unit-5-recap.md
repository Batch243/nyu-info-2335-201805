# Unit 5 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 5 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-5/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 5 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/8166863c204742fbb4a7672587b759251d).

We took some time to work on the [Inventory Management App](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/inventory-app/project.md), which is due by Wednesday at 5pm. Then we learned how to test our Python applications in an automated way.

Its important to me that all students receive enough individual attention and support. So if you are feeling behind or super stressed out, stop by the classroom for office hours sometime after 5pm on Wednesday, and I will try to help you out.

On Wednesday night, we will actually be focusing on APIs and processing data from the Internet this time. See you then!

\- Professor Rossetti

PS - A pseudocode python test which specifies a new set of expectations for what I should do next time the WiFi goes down:

```py
from time import sleep
from prof_rossetti import prof_laptop
from nyu_classroom import classroom_projector

def test_wifi_failover():
  prof_laptop.wifi.disconnect # a scenario where the wifi gets disconnected
  sleep(60) # wait a minute as I realize it is disconnected and switch display sources
  assert classroom_projector.display_source == "Classroom PC"
```
