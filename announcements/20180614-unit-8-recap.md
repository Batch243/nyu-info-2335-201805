# Unit 8 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 8 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-8/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 8 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/d8d143facecd40dcad151e813d312fd01d).

During the first half of class, we participated in a "Design Thinking" workshop led by some folks from IBM.

During the rest of class, we breifly discussed some concepts related to the management of software development, and I also introduced the [Freestyle Project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/freestyle/project.md).

Please remember to submit your weekly checkins sometime between Thursday at 9am and Monday at 9am. And please also submit your [Freestyle Project Proposal](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/freestyle/proposal.md) by Monday at 9am.

We will use all of class time on Monday night to work on the Freestyle Project Deliverable. I encourage you to see how far you can get over the weekend. :smiley_cat:
